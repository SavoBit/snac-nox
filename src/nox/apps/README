Directory: src/nox/apps

Base directory for applications.  All application code should be in this
directory or one of its subdirectories.  Apps can be added one of two
ways:

- Add a python file to pyapps directory and update meta.xml 

- Create a directory (see simpleapp/ as an example) and add all .hh,
  .cc, .i and .py files for the app.  This will require the creation of
  an xml file to describe the apps dependencies.

Note, utility code should be added to nox/lib/.  The general rule of
thumb is, if its stateless, it should be there.
